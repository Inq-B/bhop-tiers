The following Tiers are based on difficulty with regard to the following three (3) factors:

1. Speed Control - This refers to controlling speed at high and low velocity in a map. The higher the Tier, the more variability, the more consistency.

2. Technical Ability - This refers to the degree of difficulty required in terms of skill-sets in a map. Strafing, judgment of gaps, crouch jumps, utilization of multi-disciplinary techniques like climb, ladders, surfing, slide, will possibly be necessary the higher the Tier. Mastery of these skills, and being able to shift between them quickly or combine them, is a must for higher Tiers.

3. Precision - This refers to the degree of precise movement required in a map. The higher the Tier, the more refined a skill and the more accurate the inputs have to be to complete a section of the map. Quick strafes, well timed crouches, and small gaps innately create more difficulty in this category.
#
### **Tier 0 (N/A)** 
A map with no emphasis on speed control, technique or technical ability, or any amount of precision. A map that cannot be failed or is deemed a meme map. In rare cases, this is a map that is impossible or cannot be Tiered.

Example(s): bhop_bfur, bhop_strafestrafestrafe, bhop_desertbus, bhop_brappian
#
### **Tier 1 (Novice)**
A map for novices with the most minor emphasis on speed control, technical ability, and precision. The map can include minor obstacles to traverse, such as flat terrain, minor jumps, or short gaps that can require jumping or could be edge crouched. This is the easiest bhop map to qualify for Tiering. The map can be hard to fail or has so many checkpoints that its progression provides very little to no punishment by way of reset.

Example(s): bhop_stref_amazon, bhop_mp_stairs_dev, bhop_freedompuppies
#
### **Tier 2 (Novice+)** 
A map for novices with minor or adequate emphasis on speed control, technical ability, and precision. The map contains gaps that require jumping, some may be larger and require pre-speed or multiple jumps to traverse. This can include obstacles such as elevated jumps, crouch jumps, or other varied but simple hurdles--however, they are not employed extensively. Gaps between checkpoints or reset triggers can be further apart than a Tier 1--and can punish the player in a minor way, making progression and reward more evident.

Example(s): bhop_eazy_v2, bhop_danmark, bhop_ocean, bhop_larena, bhop_cobblestone
#
### **Tier 3 (Advanced Beginner)** 
A map for beginners shifting into more comfortability with variances in bhop. The map uses speed control, technical ability, and precision in a noticeable fashion, where a novice would struggle. There is a difficulty progression and varied gameplay that can actively challenge the player. These challenges can still be separated by checkpoints, or the obstacles can be paced well enough that punishment seems fair and reasonable for players progressing into a less casual play-style. This is no longer considered one of the learning or foundational novice maps, and Tier 1 and 2 may still be recommended before attempting.

Example(s): bhop_monster_jam, bhop_cherry, bhop_addict_v2, bhop_thc, bhop_sahara
#
### **Tier 4 (Competent)** 
A map beyond the novice or beginner Tiering. The map places a concrete emphasis on speed control, technical ability, and precision. Obstacles can range in terms of their required skill-set and can be more frequent and can begin to get challenging as compared with the novice and beginner tiers. There can be several actions that are difficult to perform initially and require practice to complete or to optimize for a run. This map can have fewer checkpoints, or has obstacles that can be difficult enough that progressing to the next checkpoint can be difficult for those without time spent working on foundational bhop skills.

Example(s): bhop_voyage, bhop_arcane_v2, bhop_lego, bhop_haddock, bhop_cutekittenz, bhop_toc, bhop_underground_crypt, bhop_fury, bhop_pharma
#
### **Tier 5 (Competent+)**
A map in a middle-range difficulty--defined as an intermediate Tier. The map can constantly challenge the player with stamina-based obstacles or more arduous obstacles that can have a range of applications; from larger gaps, some refined movements or tight turns, maintaining speed to progress, or navigating smaller spaces or blocks, etc. This is a solid map that can incorporate speed control, technical ability, and precision in an integral way to make a semi-challenging experience.

Example(s): bhop_lego2, bhop_fps_max, bhop_drop, bhop_fruits2, bhop_flocci
#
### **Tier 6 (Proficient)**
A map that exceeds general competency through bhop and can start becoming a challenge. The map can combine use of obstacles and challenge the player with use of speed control, technical ability, and precision. This map is beyond intermediate difficulty and can broach territory where specific honed skills are necessary. Unique unit based bhop, large gaps, specialized jumps, use of multi-discipline, etc.--or uncommon skills can be necessary to complete the map.

Example(s): bhop_null_fix, bhop_badges, bhop_exodus, bhop_alvo2, bhop_sqee, bhop_catalyst_fix, bhop_rpg
#
### **Tier 7 (Proficient+)** 
A map that can create a definitive and unique challenge that almost approaches expert level. The map can be fairly challenging but does not create an experience that is entirely inaccessible. Commonly, players with experience can get stuck at impasses throughout the map--until skills are increased to match the unique integration and use of speed control, technical ability, and precision. Most skills can be used in tandem and can be used continually throughout the map. Levity or segues for giving the player relief or easier intermission sections to split up pacing can be sparse, if these are present at all.

Example(s): bhop_indest_beta, bhop_aux_a9, bhop_Exceptional, bhop_inmomentum_gfl, bhop_cetz, bhop_pj_sibal
#
### **Tier 8 (Expert)**
A map that pushes difficulty into the expert level--without being entirely inaccessible. Seasoned or experienced bhop players can possibly be familiar with some of the skills necessary to complete the map, but the unique use of speed control, technical ability, and precision can make completion of the map stiffly difficult. Many impasses can exist in the map that can even prevent the most seasoned players from no-fail completions. Resets can become punishing, unforgiving, and generally only reward those that study the map. There can be few checkpoints, or there can be large segments of the map that are considered linear. Not only can stamina be employed, but that in tandem with usage of unique or niche or high-level skills can be what makes the map difficult.

Example(s): bhop_triumph, bhop_challenging, bhop_priexaliblyat
#
### **Tier 9 (Expert+)** 
A map that broaches master level. This map can be practically inaccessible to players who haven't continually and thoroughly practiced the map or the skills necessary to complete the map. The map can integrate incredibly difficult bhop or other unique and varied skills that can exhibit a near mastery of speed control, technical ability, and precision. The map can contain a multitude of impasses that can frustrate a majority of players and prevent most from completing the map. The map can use stamina as not an element of difficulty--but an expectation alongside incredibly specified and niche bhop. The map can have the same standard for challenges that are multi-disciplinary (ladders, climb, surf, etc). The map can be thoroughly punishing and can provide almost no levity or forgiveness to the player. Maps can be linear or contain stages that have no present checkpoints.

Example(s): bhop_wrath, bhop_kirous, bhop_4muddz
#
### **Tier 10 (Master/TAS)** 
A map with the highest potential defined standard available of the following: speed control, technical ability, and precision. This map can be inaccessible to the majority of players. The map can be difficult for veterans and experts to complete. The map can include large gaps, technical strafes and turns, micro-movements, massive punishment for failure, contain no checkpoints for failure, have incredibly niche and unique bhop skills or multi-disciplinary skills that are necessary to complete the map (ladders, climb, surf, etc). The map can be uniquely unwieldy, require unparalleled stamina and patience, but is possible in some form or another without entering Tier 0 territory for impossibility or being torturous in the way a meme map would be deemed.

Example(s): bhop_4matan, kz_bhop_knothard, bhop_cetz_hard
